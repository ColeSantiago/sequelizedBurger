# burger-handlebars-app

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, and devour them. 

--------
This app was built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. Node and MySQL query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

How the app works for the user:
--
*  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page.

*  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

*  The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

It can be run on a node server with a mysql database, or found at:
